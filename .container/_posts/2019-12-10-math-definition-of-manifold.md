The machine learning community has borrowed lots of terminologies from mathematics. To gain a deeper understanding of the feature learning/dimension reduction approaches, I make some notes of the rigorous definition in math. 
## Some definition in topology

1. **homeomorphism**: If \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are topological spaces, a homromorphism from \\(X\\) to \\(Y\\) is a bijective map \\(\varphi: X\rightarrow Y\\) such that  \\(\varphi\\) and \\(\varphi^{-1}\\) are continuous.
2. **H**
   
    An simple topology:
    Let Z be the set\{1, 2, 3\}, and declare the open subsets to be \{1\}, \{1, 2\}, \{1, 2, 3\} and \\(\varnothing\\)
