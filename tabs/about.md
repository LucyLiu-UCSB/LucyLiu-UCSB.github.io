I am Xi (Lucy) Liu, a PhD candidate in Statistics at University of California, Santa Barbara. My previous research is centered on functional/longitudinal data analysis, optimization and statistical inference on clinical data. I am supervised under Professor [Alexander Petersen](http://alexanderpetersen.org/) who is one of the most talented young researchers I’ve ever known.

I am a big LEGO fan. I am wondering if it is possible to create such software/algorithm that when people input several photos of the object, it will output a building instruction. For now, I can not figure out a framework or workflow for this. This is the first motivation for me to change my research direction because I decided to turn to deep learning for help. Recently, I started to read mathematical graduate textbooks about manifold, topology and optimal transport.

I am also a marathoner. I finished 2018 Chicago marathon within 4 hours.
